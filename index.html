        <h1>Appetizers</h1>
        <p>
          Appetizers are what you eat before the main course, and in many cases,
          they can affect your entire experience at a restaurant. Appetizers are
          an essential part of the menu at any restaurant. Often, they're
          considered the most crucial part of your meal since they set the tone
          for the remainder of your meal.

        <h1>Pasta</h1>
        <p>
          Pasta is made from grain, one of the basic food groups in a healthy
          diet that also can include vegetables, fruits, fish, and poultry. It's
          a good source of energy and can give you fiber, too, if it's made from
          whole grain. That can help with stomach problems and may help lower
          cholesterol.

          folate, fiber, and phytonutrients (see Table 1). Leafy vegetables are
          a good choice for a healthful diet because they do not contain

        <h1>Pizza</h1>
        <p>
          Pizza can help you absorb the antioxidant Lycopene. Lycopene is found
          in tomatoes, which are used to make the base sauce for pizzas.
          Lycopene helps to lower blood pressure and bring down high
          cholesterol. It's also more easily absorbed from cooked tomatoes as
          opposed to fresh tomatoes.
